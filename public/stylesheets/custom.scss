// This code is to import all ofd Bootstrap, however only importing what you need is encouraged. I've decided to import everything until I get a better idea of what components I want to use. Then I can go back and import different components separately. Instructions for doing so are here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/sass/
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
