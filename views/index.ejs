        <p class="lead">Benford's law is an observation that in many real-life sets of numerical data, the leading digit is likely to be small.</p>
        <p>In sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5% of the time. Benford's law also makes predictions about the distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on. </p>
        <p>It has been shown that this result applies to a wide variety of data sets, including electricity bills, street addresses, stock prices, house prices, population numbers, death rates, lengths of rivers, and physical and mathematical constants.

<!-- TO DO - nice-to-haves
-Responsive design. I'd like the graph to pop above the text once the screen isn't wide enough.
-Dark mode default. Light mode option. -->


<!-- Displaying First-Digit Distribution Graphs:

    Difficulty: Moderate
    Description: This feature involves generating graphs to visualize the first-digit distribution of the user's input data and comparing it with Benford's Law distribution.
    Required Skills: You'll need to work with data visualization libraries like Chart.js or D3.js to create the graphs. Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is necessary to integrate and customize the graphs on the webpage.
    Benefits: Visualizing the data with graphs will provide users with a better understanding of the distribution and how it compares to Benford's Law.
    *****Gonna use Chart.js because it's a kinder learning curve, though it has less customization***** https://www.chartjs.org/

Adjustable Sensitivity of the Law Calculator:

    Difficulty: Moderate to Advanced
    Description: Allowing users to adjust the sensitivity of the law calculator requires adding a user interface (UI) component, such as a slider or input field, to control the percentage range.
    Required Skills: This feature involves both frontend and backend work. You'll need to handle user input on the frontend and update the backend calculation based on the adjusted sensitivity. It may require additional validation and error handling for user input.
    Benefits: Offering adjustable sensitivity gives users more control over the analysis, allowing them to customize the application's behavior according to their specific needs. -->
