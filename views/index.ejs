        <p class="lead">Benford's law is an observation that in many real-life sets of numerical data, the leading digit is likely to be small.</p>
        <p>In sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5% of the time. Benford's law also makes predictions about the distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on. </p>
        <p>It has been shown that this result applies to a wide variety of data sets, including electricity bills, street addresses, stock prices, house prices, population numbers, death rates, lengths of rivers, and physical and mathematical constants.
